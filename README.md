CryptDown
=======

CryptDown is a Microservice to store documents, pastes or code snippets, similar to pastebin.

It uses real 256bit AES encryption, which takes place directly in your browser. No plaintext is ever being send. Nobody can help you when you loose an encryption password for a paste. Your IP-Address will not be saved!

The 1st CryptDown instance can be found on [cryptdown.eu](https://cryptdown.eu). Feel free to improve this tool, give feedback, or create a new self-hosted instance.

CryptDown was build with the following great and free software:

* [Fat-Free Framework](https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree)
* CryptoJS
* MediumEditor
* Showdown.js
* to-markdown.js
* jQuery
* Twitter Bootstrap
* font-awesome

#### Security

This tool is just for testing purpose and a personal playground. Don't blame me if you loose your data, keys, or think it lacks on security.

Please file an issue for support and improvements.
